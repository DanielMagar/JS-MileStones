    Basic Operators:
        Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment operators.

    Control Structures:
        Conditionals: if, else, else if, switch
        Loops: for, while, do while

    Functions:
        Defining functions, function parameters, return values.
        Arrow functions.

Practice:

    Build a simple calculator.
    Write programs using loops and conditionals (e.g., a number guessing game).

Milestone 2: Intermediate Concepts (Week 3-4)
Goal: Dive deeper into objects, arrays, and key language features.

Topics:

    Arrays:
        Creating arrays, accessing elements, array methods (push, pop, map, filter, etc.).

    Objects:
        Object literals, accessing and updating properties, this keyword.
        Object methods.

    Functions (Advanced):
        Function expressions, IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), closures.
        Callback functions.

    Error Handling:
        try, catch, finally, error objects, throwing custom errors.

    ES6+ Features:
        Template literals, destructuring, default parameters, rest and spread operators.
        let, const, block scoping.

Practice:

    Create a simple Todo list application using arrays and objects.
    Practice with different array methods (map, reduce, filter).

Milestone 3: DOM Manipulation & Events (Week 5-6)
Goal: Learn how to interact with the browser and manipulate HTML dynamically.

Topics:

    The DOM (Document Object Model):
        What is the DOM, selecting DOM elements (querySelector, getElementById, etc.).

    Manipulating DOM:
        Modifying HTML content, adding/removing elements, changing attributes, and styles dynamically.

    Events:
        Event listeners, event propagation (bubbling/capturing), event delegation.
        Common events: click, input, submit, keydown.

    Forms & Validations:
        Working with forms, input handling, basic form validation.

    Introduction to Browser APIs:
        localStorage, sessionStorage, setTimeout, setInterval.

Practice:

    Build a simple interactive form that responds to user input.
    Create a "to-do list" app with DOM manipulation and event handling.

Milestone 4: Asynchronous JavaScript (Week 7-8)
Goal: Understand asynchronous behavior and master handling async code with promises, callbacks, and async/await.

Topics:

    Understanding the Event Loop:
        Synchronous vs asynchronous code.
        The call stack, the event loop, and the message queue.

    Callbacks:
        What are callbacks, common callback patterns.

    Promises:
        Introduction to Promises, then(), catch(), finally() methods.
        Chaining promises.

    Async/Await:
        Introduction to async and await.
        Converting promise-based code into async/await.

    Fetching Data from APIs:
        Using fetch() for AJAX requests, handling JSON data, and API responses.
        Error handling in async code.

Practice:

    Build a weather app that fetches data from a public API.
    Use async/await and promises for handling asynchronous code.

Milestone 5: JavaScript Design Patterns & OOP (Week 9-10)
Goal: Learn how to structure and design large applications using JavaScript OOP and design patterns.

Topics:

    Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript:
        Introduction to OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance).
        class syntax in ES6, constructors, prototypes.

    Inheritance and Polymorphism:
        Extending classes, method overriding, and super().

    Encapsulation and Abstraction:
        Private and public methods, encapsulating logic.

    Design Patterns:
        Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Module pattern, Observer pattern.
        MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

Practice:

    Implement a simple e-commerce cart using OOP principles.
    Write an event-driven system using the Observer pattern.

Milestone 6: JavaScript in Front-End Frameworks (Week 11-12)
Goal: Learn how JavaScript powers modern web applications using libraries and frameworks like React.
