What is JavaScript ? 
- JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used to create interactive effects within web browsers. 
- It can be used for both front-end and back-end development.
- JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
- The programs in this language are called scripts. 
- They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
- Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
- It was invented by Brendan Eich. 

- Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

-The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

- Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

    V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
    SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
    …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

    # In-browser JavaScript is able to:

    - Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
    - React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
    - Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
    - Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
    - Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
